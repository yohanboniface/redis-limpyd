Limpyd
======

Idea is to provide an **easy** way to store objects in `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_, 
**without losing the power and the control of the Redis API**, in a *limpid* way. So, scope is to 
provide just as abstraction as needed.

For example:

- Don't care about keys, `limpyd` do it for you
- Retrieve objects from some of their attributes
- Retrieve objects collection
- CRUD abstraction
- Keep the power of all the `Redis data types <http://redis.io/topics/data-types>`_ in your own code

**This is full R&D, so *do not* try to use it in production right now!**

Example of configuration::

    from limpyd import model
    
    main_database = model.RedisDatabase(
        host="localhost",
        port=6379,
        db=0
    )

    class Bike(model.RedisModel):

        database = main_database

        name = model.HashableField(indexable=True, unique=True)
        color = model.HashableField()
        wheels = model.StringField(default=2)


So you can use it like this::

    >>> mountainbike = Bike(name="mountainbike")
    >>> mountainbike.wheels.get()
    '2'
    >>> mountainbike.wheels.incr()
    >>> mountainbike.wheels.get()
    '3'
    >>> mountainbike.name.set("tricycle")
    >>> tricycle = Bike.collection(name="tricycle")[0]
    >>> tricycle.wheels.get()
    '3'
    >>> tricycle.hmset(color="blue")
    True
    >>> tricycle.hmget('color')
    ['blue']
    >>> tricycle.hmget('color', 'name')
    ['blue', 'tricycle']
    >>> tricycle.color.hget()
    'blue'
    >>> tricycle.color.hset('yellow')
    True
    >>> tricycle.hmget('color')
    ['yellow']

About
*****

`redis-limpyd` is a project initiated by `Yohan Boniface <https://github.com/yohanboniface/>`_, using python to store "models" in Redis_.

The project can be found here: https://github.com/yohanboniface/redis-limyd

Yohan is helped in the developement by `St√©phane "Twidi" Angel <https://github.com/twidi/>`_, with lot of work on his branches, aimed to be integrated upstream via pull requests when we have time to review code.
You can found these branches here: https://github.com/twidi/redis-limpyd/branches (the `develop` branch is generally up to date with the work on all of them)

If you want to help, please fork (`master` or a feature branch, not `develop`) and work on a branch with a comprehensive name, write tests (seriously, everything is severely tested in `limpyd`) and make a pull request.

.. _RedisDatabase: Database_

********
Database
********

The first element to define when using `limpyd` is the database. The main goal of the database is to handle the conneciton to Redis_ and to host the models.

It's easy to define a database, as its arguments are the same as for a standard connection to Redis_ via `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_::

    from limpyd.database import RedisDatabase
    
    main_database = RedisDatabase(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

Then it's also easy to define the database (which is mandatory) on which a model is defined::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        some_field = fields.StringField()

If you have more than one model to host on a database, it's a good idea to create an abstract model::

    class BaseModel(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        abstract = True

    class Foo(BaseModel):
        foo_field = fields.StringField()

    class Bar(BaseModel):
        bar_field = fields.StringField()

Note that you cannot have two models with the same name (the name of the class) in the same database (for obvious collusion problems), but we provide a namespace attribute on models to resolve this problem (so you can use an external module with models named as yours). See Models_ to know how to use them.

It's not a good idea to declare many RedisDatabase_ objects on the same Redis_ database (defined with host+port+db), because of obvious colusion problems if models have the same name in each. So do it only if you really know what you're doing, and with different models only.



.. _RedisModel: Models_

******
Models
******

Models_ are the core of limpyd, it's why we're here. A RedisModel_ is a class, in a database, with some fields. Each instance of this model is a new object stored in Redis_ by `limpyd`.

Here a simple example::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database

        foo = field.StringField()
        bar = field.StringField()

To create an instance, it's as easy as::

    >>> example = Example(foo='FOO', bar='BAR')

By just doing this, the fields are created, and a PKField_ is set with a value that you can use::

    >>> print "New example object with pk #%s" % example.pk.get()
    New example object with pk #1

Then later to get an instance from Redis_ with it's pk, it's as simple as::

    >>> example = Example(1)

So, to create an object, pass fields and their values as named arguments, and to retrieve it, pass its pk as the only argument. To retrieave instances via other fields than the pk, check the Collections_ section later in this document.

If you don't pass any argument to the RedisModel_, default one from fields are taken and are saved. But if no arguments and no default values, you get an empty instance, with no filled fields and no pk set. 

The pk will be created with the first field. It's important to know that we do not store any concept of "model", each field is totally independent, thought the keys to save them in Redis_ are based on the object's pk. So you can have 50 fields in a model and save only one of them.

Another really important thing to know is that when you create/retrieve an object, there is absolutely no data stored in it. Each time you access data via a field, the data is fetched from Redis_, except if you use the Cache_ (actually activated by default)

Model attributes
================

When defining a model, you will add fields, but there is also some other attributes that are mandatory or may be useful.

**database**

The `database` attribute is mandatory and must be a RedisDatabase_ instance. See Database_

**namespace**

You can't have two models with the same name on the same database. Except if you use namespacing. 

Each model has a `namespace`, default to an empty string. 

The `namespace` can be used to regroup models. All models about registration could have the `namespace` "registration", ones about the payment could have "payment", and so on. 

With this you can have models with the same name in different `namespaces`, because the Redis_ keys created to store your data is computed with the `namespace`, the model name, and the pk of objects.

**abstract**

If you have many models sharing some field names, and/or within the same database and/or the same namespace, it could be useful to regroup all common stuff into a "base model", without using it to really store data in Redis_.

For this you have the `abstract` attribute, `False` by default::

    class Content(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        namespace = "content"
        abstract = True

        title = fields.HashableField()
        pub_date = field.HashableField()

    class Article(Content):
        content = fields.StringField()

    class Image(Content):
        path = fields.HashableField()

In this example, only `Article` and `Image` are real models, both using the `main_database` database, the namespace "content", and having `title` and `pub_date` fields, in addition to their own.


**cacheable**

As we don't store field values in the object, and to avoid querying Redis_ each time we need a value, `limpyd` implements a level of local cache. It's activated by default, just set the `cacheable` attribute on the model to False to deactivate it.

See Cache_ for more informations about this local cache.



******
Fields
******

The core module of `limpyd` provides 5 fields types, matching the ones in Redis_:

- StringField_, for the main data type in `Redis`, strings
- HashableField_, for hashes
- SetField_, for sets
- ListField_, for lists
- SortedSetField_, for sorted sets

You can also manage primary keys with these too fields:

- PKField_, based on StringField_
- AutoPKField_, same as PKField_ but auto-incremented.

All these fields can be indexed, cached, and manage the keys for you (they take the same arguments as the real Redis_ ones, as defined in the `StrictRedis` class of `redis-py`_, but without the `key` parameter)

Another thing all fields have in common, is the way to delete them: use the `delete` method on a field, and both the field and its value will be removed from Redis_.



Field attributes
================

When adding fields to a model, you can configure it with some attributes:

**cacheable**

We provide a way to deactivate cache on a specific field is the cache is activated on the model. Simply pass the `cacheable` argument to False.

For more informations about the cache, check Cache_.


**default**

It's possible to set default values for fields of type StringField_ and HashableField_::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        foo = fields.StringField(default='FOO')
        bar = fields.StringField()

    >>> example = Example(bar='BAR')
    >>> example.foo.get()
    'FOO'

When setting a default value, the field will be saved when creating the instance. If you defined a PKField_ (not AutoPKField_), don't forget to pass a value for it when creating the instance, it's needed to store other fields.


**indexable**

Sometimes getting objects from Redis_ by its primary key is not what you want. You may want to search for objects with a specific value for a specific field. 

By setting the `indexable` argument to True when defining the field, this functionnality is automatically activated, and you'll be able to retrieve objects by filtering on this field using Collections_.

To activate it, just set the `indexable` argument to True::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        foo = fields.StringField(indexable=True)
        bar = fields.StringField()

In this example you will be able to filter on the field `foo` but not on `bar`.

See Collections_ to know how to filter objects.

**unique**

The `unique` argument is the same as the `indexable` one, except it will ensure that you can't have multiple objects with the same value for some fields. `unique` fields are also indexed, and can be filtered, as for the `indexable` argument.

Example::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        foo = fields.StringField(indexable=True)
        bar = fields.StringField(unique=True)

    >>> example1 = Example(foo='FOO', bar='BAR')
    True
    >>> example2 = Example(foo='FOO', bar='BAR')
    UniquenessError: Key :example:bar:BAR already exists (for instance 1)

See Collections_ to know how to filter objects, as for `indexable`.



Field types
===========


StringField
-----------

StringField_ based fields allow the storage of strings, but some `Redis string commands <http://redis.io/commands#string>`_ allow to treat them as integer, float or bits.

Example::

    from limpyd import model, fields
    
    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        
        name = fields.StringField()

You can use this model like this::
    
    >>> example = Example(name='foo')
    >>> example.name.get()
    'foo'
    >>> example.name.set('bar')
    >>> example.name.get()
    'bar'
    >> example.delete()

The StringField_ type support these `Redis string commands`_:

**Getters:**

- `get`
- `getbit`
- `getrange`
- `getset`
- `strlen`

**Modifiers:**

- `append`
- `decr`
- `decrby`
- `getset`
- `incr`
- `incrby`
- `incrbyfloat`
- `set`
- `setbit`
- `setnx`
- `setrange`


HashableField
-------------

As for StringField_, HashableField_ based fields allow the storage of strings. But all the `HashableField` fields of an instance are stored in the same Redis_ hash, the name of the field being the key in the hash.

To fully use the power of Redis_ hashes, we also provide two methods to get and set multiples field in one operation (see hmget_ and hmset_). It's usually cheaper to store fields in hash that in strings. And it's faster to set/retrieve them using these two commands.

Example with simple commands::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database

        foo = fields.HashableField()
        bar = fields.HashableField()

    >>> example.foo.hset('FOO')
    1  # 1 because the hash field was created
    >>> example.foo.hget()
    'FOO'

The HashableField_ type support these `Redis hash commands <http://redis.io/commands#hash>`_:

**Getters:**

- hget

**Modifiers:**

- `hincrby`
- `hincrbyfloat`
- `hset`
- `hsetnx`

**Deleter:**

* Note that to delete the value of a HashableField_, you can use the `hdel` command, which do the same as the main `delete` one.

**Multi:**

The two following commands are not called on the fields themselves, but on an instance.

- hmget_
- hmset_

hmget
"""""

hmget_ is called directly on an instance, and expects a list of field names to retrieve.

The result will be, as in Redis_, a list of all values, in the same order.

If no names are provided, all the HashableField_ based fields will be fetched.

It's up to you to associate names and values, but you can find an example below::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database

        foo = fields.HashableField()
        bar = fields.HashableField()

        def hmget_dict(self, *args):
            """
            A call to hmget but which return a dict with field names as keys, instead
            of only a list of values
            """
            values = self.hmget(*args)
            keys = args or self._hashable_fields
            return dict(zip(keys, values))


    >>> example = Example(foo='FOO', bar='BAR')
    >>> example.hmget('foo', 'bar')
    ['FOO', 'BAR']
    >>> example.hmget_dict('foo', 'bar')
    {'bar': 'BAR', 'foo': 'FOO'}

hmset
"""""

hmset_ is the reverse of hmget_, and also called directly on an instance, and expects
named arguments with field names as keys, and new values to set as values.

Example (with same model as for hmget_)::

    >>> example = Example()
    >>> example.hmset(foo='FOO', bar='BAR')
    True
    >>> example.hmget('foo', 'bar')
    ['FOO', 'BAR']


SetField
--------

SetField_ based fields can store many values in one field, using the set data type of Redis_, an unordered set (with unique values).

Example::

    from limpyd import model, fields
    
    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        
        stuff = fields.SetField()

You can use this model like this::
    
    >>> example = Example()
    >>> example.stuff.sadd('foo', 'bar')
    2  # number of values really added to the set
    >>> example.stuff.smembers()
    set(['foo', 'bar'])
    >>> example.stuff.sismember('bar')
    True
    >>> example.stuff.srem('bar')
    True
    >>> example.stuff.smembers()
    set(['foo'])
    >>> example.stuff.delete()
    True

The SetField_ type support these `Redis set commands <http://redis.io/commands#set>`_:

**Getters:**

- `scard`
- `sismember`
- `smembers`
- `srandmember`

**Modifiers:**

- `sadd`
- `spop`
- `srem`


ListField
---------

ListField_ based fields can store many values in one field, using the list data type of Redis_. Values are ordered, and are not unique (you can push many times the same value).

Example::

    from limpyd import model, fields
    
    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        
        stuff = fields.ListField()

You can use this model like this::
    
    >>> example = Example()
    >>> example.stuff.rpush('foo', 'bar')
    2  # number of values added to the list
    >>> example.stuff.lrange(0, -1)
    ['foo', 'bar']
    >>> example.stuff.lindex(1)
    'bar'
    >>> example.stuff.lrem(1, 'bar')
    1  # number of values really removed
    >>> example.stuff.lrange(0, -1)
    ['foo']
    >>> example.stuff.delete()
    True

The ListField_ type support these `Redis list commands <http://redis.io/commands#list>`_:

**Getters:**

- `lindex`
- `llen`
- `lrange`

**Modifiers:**

- `linsert`
- `lpop`
- `lpush`
- `lpushx`
- `lrem`
- `lset`
- `ltrim`
- `rpop`
- `rpush`
- `rpushx`


SortedSetField
--------------

SortedSetField_ based fields can store many values, each scored, in one field using the sorted-set data type of Redis_. Values are unique (it's a set), and are ordered by their score.

Example::

    from limpyd import model, fields
    
    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        
        stuff = fields.SortedSetField()

You can use this model like this::
    
    >>> example = Example()
    >>> example.stuff.zadd(foo=2.5, bar=1.1)
    2  # number of values added to the sorted set
    >>> example.stuff.zrange(0, -1)
    ['bar', 'foo']
    >>> example.stuff.zrangebyscore(1, 2, withscores=True)
    [('bar', 1.1)]
    >>> example.stuff.zrem('bar')
    1  # number of values really removed
    >>> example.stuff.zrangebyscore(1, 2, withscores=True)
    []
    >>> example.stuff.delete()
    True

The SortedSetField_ type support these `Redis sorted set commands <http://redis.io/commands#sorted_set>`_:

**Getters:**

- `zcard`
- `zcount`
- `zrange`
- `zrangebyscore`
- `zrank`
- `zrevrange`
- `zrevrangebyscore`
- `zrevrank`
- `zscore`

**Modifiers:**

- `zadd`
- `zincrby`
- `zrem`
- `zremrangebyrank`
- `zremrangebyscore`


PKField
-------

PKField_ is a special subclass of StringField_ that manage primary keys of models. The PK of an object cannot be updated, as it serves to create keys of all its stored fields. It's this PK that is returned, with others, in Collections_.

A PK can contain any sort of string you want: simple integers, float, long uuid, names...

If you want a PKField which will be automatically filled, and auto-incremented, see AutoPKField_. Otherwise, with standard PKField_, you must assign a value to it when creating an instance.

By default, a model has a AutoPKField_ attached to it, named `pk`. But you can redefine the nameand type of PKField you want.

Examples::

    class Foo(model.RedisModel):
        """
        The PK field is `pk`, and will be auto-incremented.
        """
        database = main_database

    class Bar(model.RedisModel):
        """
        The PK field is `id`, and will be auto-incremented.
        """
        database = main_database
        id = fields.AutoPKField()

    class Baz(model.RedisModel):
        """
        The PK field is `name`, and won't be auto-incremented, so you must assign it a value when creating an instance.
        """
        database = main_database
        name = fields.PKField()

Note that wathever name you use for the PKField_ (or AutoPKField_), you can always access it via the name `pk` (but also we its real name). It's easier for abstraction.

To access the pk value of an object, you have many ways::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        id = fields.AutoPKField()
        name = fields.StringField()

    >>> example = Example(name='foobar')
    >>> example.get_pk()
    1
    >>> example.pk.get()
    1
    >>> example.id.get()
    1


AutoPKField
-----------

A AutoPKField_ field is a PKField_ filled with auto-incremented integers, starting to 1. Assigning a value to of AutoPKField_ is forbidden.

It's a AutoPKField_ that is attached by default to every model, if no other one is defined.

See PKField_ for more details.



***********
Collections
***********

The main and obvious way to get data from Redis_ via `limpyd` is to know the primary key of objects and instantiate them one by one.

But some fields can be indexed, passing them the `indexable` or `unique` attribute. 

If fields are indexed, it's possible to make query to retrieve many of them, using the `collection` method on the models.

The filtering has some limitations:

- you can only filter on fields with `indexable` and/or `unique` attributes set to True
- you can only filter on full values (`limyd` doesn't provide filters like "startswith", "contains"...)
- all filters are "and"ed
- no "not" (only able to find mathing fields, not to exlude some)
- no "join" (filter on one model only)

The result of a call to the `collection` is lazy. The query is only sent to Redis_ when data is really needed, to display or do computation with them.

By default, a collection returns a list of primary keys for all the matching objects, but you can sort them, retrieve only a part, and/or directly get full instances instead of primary keys.

We will explain Filtering_, Sorting_, Slicing_, Instanciating_, and Lazyness_ below, based on this example::

    class Person(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        firstname = fields.HashableField(indexable=True)
        lastname = fields.HashableField(indexable=True)
        birth_year = fields.HashableField(indexable=True)

        def __repr__(self):
            return "<[%s] %s %s (%s)>" % tuple([self.get_pk()] + self.hmget('firstname', 'lastname', 'birth_year'))

    >>> Person(firstname='John', lastname='Smith', birth_year=1960)
    <[1] John Smith (1960)>
    >>> Person(firstname='John', lastname='Doe', birth_year=1965)
    <[2] John Doe (1965)>
    >>> Person(firstname='Emily', lastname='Smith', birth_year=1950)
    <[3] Emily Smith (1950)>
    >>> Person(firstname='Susan', lastname='Doe', birth_year=1960)
    <[4] Susan Doe (1960)>


Filtering
=========

To filter, simply call the `collection` (class)method with fields you want to filter as keys, and wanted values as values::

    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John')
    ['1', '2']
    >>> Person.collection(firstname='john', lastname='Smith')
    ['1']
    >>> Person.collection(birth_year=1965)
    ['2']
    >>> Person.collection(birth_year=1965, lastname='Smith')
    []

You cannot pass two filters with the same name. All filters are "and"ed.


Slicing
=======

To slice the result, simply act as it's the result of a collection is a list::

    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John')
    ['1', '2']
    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John')[1:2]
    ['2']


Sorting
=======

With the help of the `sort` command of Redis_, `limpyd` is able to sort the result of collections.

It's as simple as calling the `sort` method of the collection. Use the `by` argument to specify on which field to sort.

Redis_ default sorting is numeric. If you want to sort values lexicographically, set the `alpha` parameter to True.

Example::

    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John')
    ['1', '2']
    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John').sort(by='lastname', alpha=True)
    ['2', '1']
    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John').sort(by='lastname', alpha=True)[1:2]
    [1']
    >>> Person.collection().sort(by='birth_year')
    ['3', '1', '4', '2']




Instanciating
=============

If you want to retrieve already instanciated objects, instead of only primary keys and having to do instanciation yourself, you simply have to call `instances()` on the result of the collection. The result of the collection and its methods (`sort` and `instances`) return a collection, so you can do chaining::

    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John')
    ['1', '2']
    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John').instances()
    [<[1] John Smith (1960)>, <[2] John Doe (1965)>]
    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John').instances().sort(by='lastname', alpha=True)
    [<[2] John Doe (1965)>, <[1] John Smith (1960)>]
    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John').sort(by='lastname', alpha=True).instances()
    [<[2] John Doe (1965)>, <[1] John Smith (1960)>]
    >>> Person.collection(firstname='John').sort(by='lastname', alpha=True).instances()[0]
    [<[2] John Doe (1965)>


Lazyness
========

The result of a collection is lazy. In fact it's the collection itself, it's why we can chain calls to `sort` and `instances`.

The query is sent to Redis_ only when the data are needed. In the previous examples, data was needed to display them.

But if you do something like::

    >>> results = Person.collection(firstname='John').instances())

nothing will be done while results is not printed, iterated...



*****
Cache
*****

As we don't store field values in the object, and to avoid querying Redis_ each time we need a value, `limpyd` implements a level of local cache.


On the model
============

This cache is activated by default for each model. To deactivate it, it's as simple as adding the attribute `cacheable` to False on the model::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        cacheable = False

        a_field = fields.StringField()

The use of the cache is transparent. If you got a value from a field, without updating it after that, the next time you'll get it, the value will be fetched from the cache. When a field is updated, its cached is cleared.

Example::

    >>> example = Example()
    >>> example.a_field.set('foo')
    True
    >>> example.a_field.get()  # call Redis_
    'foo'
    >>> example.a_field.get()  # hit the cache
    'foo'
    >>> example.a_field.set('bar')  # clear the cache
    True
    >>> example.a_field.get()  # call Redis_
    'bar'


On fields
=========

If the cache is activated on the model, you can deactivate it at the field level. The reverse is not True (if the cache is deactivated for the model, you cannot activate it for a field).

To deactivate it for the field, just set the `cacheable` argument to True::

    class Example(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        foo = fields.StringField()
        bar = fields.StringField(cacheable=False)

Here the cache is activated for `foo` but not for `bar`.


WARNING
=======

Be careful that the cache is on the instance itself. If you create another instance on the same object, update a field, the cache from the first instance will not be cleared. It's also obviously the case if you work with multiple threads of workers.



*******
Contrib
*******

To keep the core of `limpyd`, say, "limpid", we limited what it contains. But we added some extra stuff in the `contrib` module:

- `Related fields`_
- Pipelines_


Related fields
==============

`limpyd` provide a way to link models, via the `related` contrib module. It's only shortcuts to already existing stuff, aiming to make relations easy.

Start with an example::

    from limpyd import fields
    from limpyd.contrib import related

    class Person(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        name = fields.PKField()  # redefine a PK just for the example

    class Group(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        name = fields.PKField()
        private = fields.StringField()
        owner = related.FKHashableField('Person')
        members = related.M2MSetField('Person', related_name='membership')


With this we can do stuff like this::

    >>> core_devs = Group(name='limpyd core devs', private=0)
    >>> ybon = Person(name='ybon')
    >>> twidi = Person(name='twidi')
    >>> core_devs.owner.hset(ybon)
    1
    >>> core_devs.members.sadd(twidi, ybon._pk)  # give a limpyd object, or a pk
    2
    >>> core_devs.members.smembers()
    set(['ybon', 'twidi'])
    >>> ybon.group_set(private=0)  # it's a collection, the limpyd way !
    ['limpyd core devs']
    >>> twidi.membership()  # it's a collection too
    ['limpyd core devs']


.. _RelatedModel: `Related model`_

Related model
-------------

To use related fields, you must use `related.RelatedModel` instead of `model.RedisModel`. It handles creation of `related collections` and manage propagation of deletion for us.

Related field types
-------------------

The `related` module provides 5 field types, based on the standard ones. All have the `indexable` attribute to True, and `cacheable` to False (for internal needs, we can't activate cache on related fields.)

There is one big addition on these fields over the normal one. Everywhere you can pass a value to store (in theory you would pass an object's primary key), you can pass an instance of a limpyd model. The primary key of these instances will be extraced for you.

Here are the new field types:

FKStringField
"""""""""""""

The FKStringField_ type is based on StringField_ and allow setting a foreign key.

It just stores the primary key of the related object in a StringField_.

FKHashableField
"""""""""""""""

The FKHashableField_ type is based on HashableField_ and allow setting a foreign key.

It works like FKStringField_ but, as a HashableField_, can be retrieved with other fields via the hmget_ method on the instance.

M2MSetField
"""""""""""

The M2MSetField_ type is based on SetField_ and allow setting many foreign keys, acting as a Many 2 Many fields.

If no order is needed, it's the best choice for M2M, because it's the lightest M2M field (memory occupation), and it's fast to check if an element is included (`sismember`, O(1)), or to remove one (`srem`, O(N) where N is the number of members to be removed.).

If you need ordering *and* unicity, check M2MSortedSetField_.

M2MListField
""""""""""""

The M2MListField_ type is based on ListField_ and allow setting many foreign keys, acting as a Many 2 Many fields.

It works like M2MSetField_, with two differences, because it's a list and not a set:

- the list of foreign keys is ordered
- we can have many times the same foreign key

This type is usefull to keep the order of the foreign keys, but as it does not ensure unicity, the use cases are less obvious.

If you need ordering *and* unicity, check M2MSortedSetField_.

M2MSortedSetField
"""""""""""""""""

The M2MSortedSetField_ type is based on SortedSetField_ and allow setting many foreign keys, acting as a Many 2 Many fields.

It works like M2MSetField_, with one differences, because it's a sorted set and not a simple set: each foreign key has a score attached to it, and the list for foreign keys is sorted by this score.

This score is usefull to keep the entries unique AND sorted. It can be a date (as a timestamp because the score must be numeric), allowing, in our example (Person/Group), to keep list of members in the order they joined the group.

Related field arguments
------------------------

The related fields accept two new arguments when declaring them. One to tell to which model it's related (to_), and one to give a name to the `related collection`_

to
"""

The first new argument (and the first in the list of accepted ones, useful to pass it without naming it), is `to`, the name of the model on which this field is related to. 

Note that the related model must be on the same database_.

It can accept a RelatedModel_::

    class Person(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        name = StringField()

    class Group(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        name = StringField()
        owner = FKStringField(Person)

In this case the RelatedModel_ must be defined before the current model.

And it can accept a string. There is two ways to define model with a string:

- the name of a RelatedModel_::

    class Group(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        owner = FKStringField('Person')

If you want to link to a model with a different namespace than the one for the current model, you can add it::

    class Group(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        owner = FKStringField('my_namespace:Person')

- 'self', to define a link to the same model on which the related field is defined::

    class Group(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        parent = FKStringField('self')


related_name
""""""""""""

The `related_name` argument is not mandatory, except in some cases described below.

This argument is the name which will be used to create the `Related collection`_ on the related model (the on described by the to_ argument)

If defined, it must be a string. This string can accept to formatable arguments: `%(namespace)s` and `%(model)s` which will be replaced by the namespace and name of the model on which the related field is defined. It's usefull for subclassing::

    class Person(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        name = StringField()

    class BaseGroup(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        namespace = 'groups'
        abstract = True

        name = StringField()
        owner = FKStringField('Person', related_name='%(namespace)s_%(model)s_set')

    class PublicGroup(BaseGroup):
        pass

    class PrivateGroup(BaseGroup):
        pass

In this example, a person will have two related collections: 

- `groups_publicgroup_set`, liked to the `parent` field of `PublicGroup`
- `groups_privategroup_set`, liked to the `parent` field of `PrivateGroup`

Note that, exept for namespace that will be automatically converted if needed, related names should be valid python identifiers.

Related collection
------------------

Related collections are the other side of the relation. They are created on the related model, based on the related_name_ argument used when creating the related field.

They are a shortcut to the real collection, but available to ease writing.

Let's define some models::


    class Person(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        name = PKStringField()

    class Group(related.RelatedModel):
        database = main_database
        name = PKStringField()
        private = fields.StringField(defaut=0)
        owner = FKStringField('Person', related_name='owned_groups')

Now we can do::

    >>> group1 = Group(name='group 1')
    >>> group2 = Group(name='group 1', private=1)
    >>> person1 = Person(name='person 1')
    >>> group1.owner.set(person1)
    >>> group2.owner.set(person1)

To retrieve groups owned by `person1`, we can use the standard way::

    >>> Group.collection(owner=person1.get_pk())
    ['group 1', 'group 2']

or, with the related collection::

    >>> person1.owned_groups()
    ['group 1', 'group 2']

These two lines return exactly the same thing, a lazy collection (See Collections_).

You can pass other filters too::

    >>> person1.owned_groups(private=1)
    ['group 2']


Update and deletion
-------------------

One of the main advantage of using related fields instead of doing it yourself, is that updates and deletions are handled as you would, transparently.

In the previous example, if the owner of a group is updated (or deleted), the previous owner doesn't have this group in its owned_group collections.

The same applies on the other side. If a person who is the owner of a group is deleted, the value of the groups'owner field is deleted too.

And it works with M2M fields too.



Pipelines
=========

In the contrib module, we provide a way to wirk with pipelines as defined in `redis-py`_, providimg abstraction to let the fields connect to the pipeline, not the real Redis_ connection (this won't be the case if you use the default pipeline in `redis-py`_)

To activate this, you have to import and to use `PipelineDatabase` instead of the default `RedisDatabase`, without touching the arguments.

Instead of doing this::

    from limpyd.database import RedisDatabase

    main_database = RedisDatabase(
        host="localhost",
        port=6379,
        db=0
    )

Just do::

    from limpyd.contrib.database import PipelineDatabase
    
    main_database = PipelineDatabase(
        host="localhost",
        port=6379,
        db=0
    )

This `PipelineDatabase` class adds two methods: pipeline_ and transaction_

pipeline
--------

The pipeline provides the same functionnalities as for the default pipeline in `redis-py`_, but it handles transparently the use of the pipeline instead of the default collection for all fields operation.

But be aware that within a pipeline you cannot get values from fields to do something with them. It's because in a pipeline, all commands are sent in bulk, and all results are retrieved in bulk too (one for each command), when exiting the pipeline.

It does not mean that you cannot set many fields in one time in a pipeline, but you must have values not depending of other fields, and, also very important, you cannot update indexable fields ! (so no related fields either, because they are all indexable)

The best use for pipelines in `limpyd`, is to get a lot of values in one pass.

Say we have this model::

    from limpyd.contrib.database import PipelineDatabase

    main_database = PipelineDatabase(
        host="localhost",
        port=6379,
        db=0
    )

    class Person(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database
        namespace='foo'
        name = fields.StringField()
        city = fields.StringField(indexable=True)

Add some data::

    Person(name='Jean Dupond', city='Paris')
    Person(name='Francois Martin', city='Paris')
    Person(name='John Smith', city='New York')
    Person(name='John Doe', city='San Franciso')
    Person(name='Paul Durand', city='Paris')

Say we have already a lot of Person saved, we can retrieve all names this way::

    persons = list(Person.collection(city='Paris').instances())
    with main_database.pipeline() as pipeline:
        for person in persons:
            person.name.get()
        names = pipeline.execute()
    print names

This will result in only one call (within the pipeline)::

    >>> ['Jean Dupond', 'Francois Martin', 'Paul Durand']

All in one only call to the Redis_ server.

Note that in pipelines you can you the `watch` command, but it's easier to use the `transaction` method described below.

transaction
-----------

The `transaction` method available on the `PipelineDatabase` object, is the same as the one in `redis-py`_, but using its own `pipeline` method.

The goal is to help using pipelines with watches.

The `watch` mechanism in Redis_ allow us to read values and use them in a pipeline, being sure that the values got in the first step were not updated by someone else since we read them.

Imagine the `incr` method doesn't exists. Here is a way to implement it with a transaction without race condition (ie without the risk of having our value updated by someone else between the moment we read it, and the moment we save it)::

    class Page(model.RedisModel):
        database = main_database  # a PipelineDatabase object
        url = fields.StringField(indexable=True)
        hits = fields.StringField()

        def incr_hits(self):
            """
            Increment the number of hits without race condition
            """

            def do_incr(pipeline):

                # transaction not started, we can read values
                previous_value = self.hits.get()

                # start the transaction (MANDATORY CALL)
                pipeline.multi()

                # set the new value
                self.hits.set(previous_value+1)


            # run `do_incr` in a transaction, watching for the hits field
            self.database.transaction(do_incr, *[self.hits])

In this example, the `do_incr` method will be aborted and executed again, restarting the transaction, each time the `hits` field of the object is updated elsewhere. So we are absolutely sure that we don't have any race conditions.

The argument of the `transaction` method are:

- **func**, the function to run, encaspulated in a transaction. It must accept a `pipeline` argument.
- **\*watches**, a list of keys to watch (if a watched key is updated, the transaction is restarted and the function aborted and executed again). Note that you can pass keys as string, or fields of limpyd model instances (so their keys will be retrieved for you).

The `transaction` method returns the value returned by the execution of its internal pipeline. In our example, it will return `[True]`.

Note that as for the `pipeline` method, you cannot update indexables fields in the transaction because read commands are used to update them.
